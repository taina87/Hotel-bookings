# Hotel-bookings

I did an analysis of the hotel booking dataset of a certain hotel to track the booking over 1 year (2015â€“2017). The dataset was provided by Kaggle dataset . The tool used for this analysis was Microsoft Power BI.
The data was connected through the Csv option since the dataset is a CSV format and then transformed in Power query. The first cleaning I did was to inspect the the data type for each column to ensure they have the correct classification and i merged the each year,day, and month into(one column) renamed it as Date

After doing some cleaning and preparation in power query, the data was loaded into power bi.

Some measures were made such as Total Bookings ,adults, total agents, cancelled reservations , Total childresn etc. were created by clicking the new measure in the home tab.After the various cleaning and preparations were made, the data was then ready for visualization.

According to the insight provided, the shortlist of the top 5 agents includes; Agent 9 which is the (highest agent), Agent 24, Agent 1, Agent 14 and Agent 7 which is the least agent
